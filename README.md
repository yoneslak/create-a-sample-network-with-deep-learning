This is a deep learning-assisted network connection.
Matrix multiplication is used to perform preprocessing.
In this operation, in order for the alignment to be done automatically,
first our model performs the alignment. 
If the alignment is not correct, 
it sends additional data to the vesicle. 
And applies them in other processes.
